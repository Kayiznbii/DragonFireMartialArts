                <label for="holdHarmless">AGREEMENT AND LIABILITY WAIVER</label>
                <p>I, the undersigned, both personally and as a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, understand
                    and agree that there is some unavoidable risk of personal injury and harm, which is indigenous to
                    physical contact sports, including those involving the martial arts. I agree that I hold
                    responsibility for any unlikely injury to the student (anyone who participates in Training with
                    DragonFire Martial Arts, which could be a child or adult) and that owners, operators, officers,
                    employees, instructors, students, or agents of DragonFire Martial Arts cannot be held responsible
                    for these injuries or death. I hereby agree to the following:
                    I am fully aware that the Martial Arts used is unarmed combat, and that contact may be used during a
                    training session, which could result in accidental injury, or in incredibly unlikely circumstances,
                    death. This includes accidental contact made by any instructor or another student and injuries could
                    include bruises, abrasions, broken bones and cartilage, concussion, organ damage, or in extreme
                    unlikely circumstances, death. These injuries may be inflicted accidentally, but also may be
                    inflicted through negligence or malfunctioning equipment.
                    I am voluntarily enrolling in Martial Arts with the knowledge of potential danger involved, and I
                    agree to accept any and all risk of injury.
                    I understand that there is occasional use of safe versions of weapons, for example bo staff, short
                    sticks, plastic knives and plastic guns, and I consent to the student’s use of these.
                    I understand that the student will be participating in strenuous physical exercise that could lead
                    to minor or serious injury.
                    I understand that the risk of injury cannot be reduced without severely limiting the instruction and
                    class technique offered.
                    I understand that no one at DragonFire Martial Arts has given the student the authority to sue any
                    of the techniques taught to the student on any person other than in training, matches,
                    demonstrations, where the student and the instructor have agreed that they are sufficiently trained
                    and qualified to do so. I understand that the student does not have the authority to demonstrate
                    their martial arts outside the lesson, or in the absence of an instructor.
                    After having fully read the risks of injury and death, I hereby waive my right to a lawsuit in the
                    extreme unlikely event of injury or death during a lesson with DragonFire Martial Arts, or outside
                    of the lesson while using the Martial Arts taught.
                    It is further expressly agreed that all instructions, services and equipment shall be undertaken by
                    student and by student’s sole risk. Instructor and/or School (facility of instruction) shall not be
                    liable for any damages arising from personal injuries sustained by Student in, on, or about the
                    premises of said school (facility of instruction), and he/she does hereby fully and forever release
                    and discharge school, its owners, employees and agents, from any and all claims demands, damages,
                    rights of action of causes of action, present or future, whether the same be known or unknown,
                    anticipated or unanticipated, resulting from or arising out of students participation in the course
                    of instructions herein.
